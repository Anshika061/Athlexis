        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>This website was born out of a deep admiration for Vinesh Phogat, a true champion who has faced both triumph and adversity with unwavering strength.</p>

                    <li>Her story isn't just about medals but also about her resilience, courage, and ability to speak truth to power.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <strong>Disqualification Incident:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vinesh was disqualified from a major competition for being just 100 grams over the weight limit.</li>
                    <li>While this was the official reason, the real story reveals deeper struggles.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <strong>Challenges Behind the Scenes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Despite her success, Vinesh faced challenges like the lack of a dedicated physiotherapist.</li>
                    <li>The National Olympic Committee (NOC) failed to provide adequate support, impacting her performance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <strong>Unfair Allegations:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>One allegation was that she failed to wear her sponsor's kit. Vinesh clarified that she was unwell and vomiting before the match, leaving her uniform stained and unwearable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <strong>Lack of Support for Athletes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When athletes speak out for their rights, they are often met with silence.</li>
                    <li>However, when they falter, they face harsh criticism, ignoring the mental and emotional pressure they carry.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <strong>Respect Beyond Victory:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In victory, athletes like Vinesh are celebrated as "Mere Bharat ki Beti" (Our Daughter of India).</li>
                    <li>Win or lose, athletes deserve respect and unwavering support from their nation.</li>
                    <li>Sports are about perseverance, heart, and prideâ€”not just winning and losing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><em>"Support our athletes, not just in their victories, but in their struggles too. For it is in those moments that true champions are made."</em></p>
        
        <p>This platform is dedicated to highlighting these stories, where the fight off the mat is as fierce as the one on it.</p>
